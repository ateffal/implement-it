## Welcome to My Web Site dedicated to implementing popular machine learning algorithms.

We will began with the most popular algorithms and those that are "easy to implement": 
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Classification 
-...

For each algorithm we will began with a short description and then will implement it step by step.
We will use [Python](https://www.python.org) for implementing the algorithm, then we will test it on fictive data then for public available data. Finaly we will compare the results with those produced by [scihit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org).

To summarize, for each algorithm, we will:
- Give a short description
- Implement it in Python step by step
- Test the algorithm using small data set
- Use the algorithm for real available public data
- Compare the results with those produced by scikit-learn

All the code will be in this form : 

```markdown
# Example of Python code.
print("Implementing linear regression from scratch")


```

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/ateffal/implement-it/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
