# Linear Regression
## Description:

We are given n observations yi of a random variable Y that we want to explain and n observations x<sub>ij</sub> for p random varibales X<sub>1</sub>, X<sub>2</sub>,..., X<sub>p</sub> that we want to use to explain Y. The linear Regression model supposess that Y an X_1, X_2, ..., X_p are linked like this : 

Yi = a0 +  a1.Xi1 + a2.Xi2 + ... + ap.Xip + epsilonei

where a0, a1,..., ap are constants that we have to estimate, and epsilonei is a N(0, sigma2) ( Normal distribution).
